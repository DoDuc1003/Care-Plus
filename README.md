# Care-Plus

This is a project by group 13 HCI - Social & Mobile Computing. It aims at sending timely rescue calls to volunteers when the elderly fall and facilitating volunteers to be instructed by medical staff remotely before they arrive and take care for elderly.

## Working Prototype

There are two parts of our final prototype, app UI implemented by Figma and userflow simulation implemented by Unity.

***Figma prototype shows the full volunteer side UI. Elderly and medical side UI, core features userflow are shown in the Unity scene.***
